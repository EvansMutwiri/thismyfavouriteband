        <div id="body"><p>Lets take a trip down memory lane.The Wailers, was a reggae roots music band created by <strong>Peter Tosh</strong>, <strong>Bob Marley</strong>, and  <strong>Bunny Wailer</strong> in 1963. By the early 1970s, Marley and Bunny Wailer had learned to play some instruments, and brothers Aston "Family Man" Barrett (bass) and Carlton Barrett (drums), had joined the band. Bob Marley vocals as well as the lyrics which are uplifting and revolutionary make the group my favourite. After Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh left the band in 1974, Marley began touring 
            with new band members as Bob Marley and the Wailers. His new backing band included the Barrett brothers, Junior Marvin and Al Anderson on lead guitar, Tyrone Downie and Earl "Wya" Lindo on keyboards, and Alvin "Seeco" Patterson on percussion. The "I Threes", consisting of <em>Judy Mowatt, Marcia Griffiths, and Marley's wife, Rita</em>, provided backing vocals.
